WADL is a python package for planning surveys over large areas using one or more UAV (Unpersoned Aerial Vehicle). WADL take in a geofence and desired gird spacing and produces a series of routes to survey the area inside the geofence. 

The project was motivated by the need for efficient route planning for multi-robot systems. WADL was designed and used in a 2019-2020 survey of 
Ad√©lie penguins over [Cape Crozier, Ross Island, Antarctica](https://goo.gl/maps/wrMTuMq5kyNxZafx8) If you are interested in the technical details please see our paper <>
