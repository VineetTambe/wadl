Coverage Path Planner
========================

``wadl`` is a python package for planning surveys over large areas using one or more UAV (Unpiloted Aerial Vehicle). WADL take in a geofence and desired gird spacing and produces a series of routes to survey the area inside the geofence. 

``wadl`` is licensed under GPL v3. More information can be found in the :ref:`license` section.

Motivation
----------

The project was motivated by the need for efficient route planning for multi-robot systems. WADL was designed and used in a 2019-2020 survey of Ad√©lie penguins over `Cape Crozier`_, Ross Island, Antarctica.
